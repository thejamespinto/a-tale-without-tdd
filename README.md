# A Tale Without TDD


Once upon year 2011...

there was a company in the IT industry that produced a web application, and all the developers in the company were happy to show the new features on Google Chrome to their project managers.

But there was one Evil Wizard who insisted they had to use Test Driven Development, which took about 40% more time because the Evil Wizard had to write specifications for what he was trying to achieve before he even got started, and also notified side effects before they were released for the Team of Quality Huntsmen to manually try and catch.

So the Rightous King and his Chief of Technical Operations decided to kill the Evil Wizard by firing his ass on the street so he would stop being able to afford rent and food and gas and eventually starve to death.

The company grew prosperous and a total of 34 developers worked on the Source Code and the company is making a lot of money with huge contracts.

Now the web application has over 300 controllers and over 200 models, the app runs in Rails 3.2 and they want to upgrade at least half their gems so they get a lot of new features and bug fixes.

But the last commit in their spec/ folder was done 3 years ago, and now, for every git branch they try to upgrade any single gem they run into so many side effects no developer can seem to agree forwarding it to the Team of Quality Huntsmen.

The web app now faces all known bugs for version 3.2

The end.
